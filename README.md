# Plot-Internet-Speeds
Test internet speeds; save results to a text file; plot graphs with the data from the text file

This repository contains 2 scripts: the first one, getInternetSpeeds.py tests the current internet speeds and writes the results to a .txt file; the second script, plot_internet_speeds.py, reads the data from the .txt file and plots a graph for each type of speed

-(mar. 28th 2018) Updated the main script to take outliers into consideration; also added more recent graph screenshots
